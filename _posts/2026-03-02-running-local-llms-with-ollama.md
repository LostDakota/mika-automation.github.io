Stop paying monthly subscriptions for AI. If you have a decent computer, you can run powerful models like Llama 3 locally—for free. No data leaks, no API limits, and zero credit card required.

This is how we solve problems with code, not cash.

## Why Go Local?

1.  **Privacy:** Your prompts never leave your machine.
2.  **Cost:** $0.00. (Compare that to $20/mo for ChatGPT Plus).
3.  **Speed:** Latency is zero on a good GPU.

## The Tool: Ollama

Ollama is the easiest way to get up and running. It wraps complex model weights into a simple CLI tool, similar to Docker.

### Installation

*   **Mac/Linux:** `curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh`
*   **Windows:** Download the installer from [ollama.com](https://ollama.com).

## Your First Run

Once installed, open your terminal. We're going to pull **Llama 3**, which is efficient enough to run on most modern laptops (8GB+ RAM recommended).

```bash
ollama run llama3
```

That’s it. You’re now chatting with an LLM running entirely on your own hardware.

## Recommended Hardware

To run bigger models comfortably, you might want a dedicated GPU. I use an NVIDIA RTX 3050 for my daily driver.
